    		<h1> How did wie get here? </h1>
    		<p>"Go, look at something green" - that's what my mum used to say to little me, after spending some time with a book. Later in highschool I found out, how good piece of advice it was - green colour helps our eyes to relax. How lucky I was to have lot's of trees in my neighbourhood! Maybe, thanks to them, I'm not completely blind today (just a little bit ;) )</p>
    		<p> Sadly, not everyone has the oportunity to go outside every 45 minutes (that's how often we should give our eyes a short brake) especially when working in front of a screen, which is of course worse for sight than a book. That's how I got this idea - everybody should be healthy, no matter what kind of job he has. </p>
    		<p>So, here it comes - complex and fun way to give your body a little treat. It takes only five minutes and can be done everywhere. Although it can be a little confusing at the beggining, don't give up. I believe in You, good luck! </p>
